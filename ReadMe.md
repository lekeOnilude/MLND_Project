## MLND Capstone Project

This is the project I submitted for [Udacity Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) on Machine Learning. The project has to deal with helping robots better understand the kind of floor texture they are walking over using data gotten from an IMU sensor.

An LSTM network was used to see if it perform optimally will little dataset avaiable. to learn more about the problem and solution visit [Kaggle](kaggle.com/c/career-con-2019)
